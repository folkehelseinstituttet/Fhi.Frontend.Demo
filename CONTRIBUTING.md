# How to contribute

So you're thinking about contributing to Fhi.Frontend.Demo? Great! Maintaining and enhancing Fhi.Frontend.Demo is a big job, so **the community's help is really appreciated.**

Helping out isn't just writing code, it also includes submitting issues, helping confirm issues and improving the documentation.

## Submitting Issues

Requests for new features and bug reports keep the project moving forward.

### Before you submit an issue

- Ensure you are running the [latest version](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/Fhi.Frontend.Demo/releases) of Fhi.Frontend.Demo
- **Search** the [issue list](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/Fhi.Frontend.Demo/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue) (including closed issues) to make sure it hasn't already been reported.

### Submitting a good issue

- Give the issue a short, clear title that describes the bug or feature request
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- If possible, include a short code example that reproduces the issue
- Use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as appropriate to make the issue and code more readable.

## Confirming Issues

Before we work on issues, we must confirm them and be able to reproduce them. Confirming issues takes up a great deal of the team's time, so making that job easier is **really appreciated**.

Issues that need confirmation will have the **confirm** label or be unlabeled and have **no milestone**. You can help us to confirm issues by;

- Add steps to reproduce the issue
- Test issues and provide feedback

## Documentation

Great documentation is essential for any open source project and Fhi.Frontend.Demo is no exception. [Our README](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/Fhi.Frontend.Demo/blob/main/README.md) often lags behind the features that have been implemented or would benefit from better examples.

**PS.** If you would like to contribute to creating an exended, and better, documentation in the form of a [Wiki](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/Fhi.Frontend.Demo/wiki), help is really appreciated!

## Fixing Bugs and Adding Features

We love pull requests, but would prefer that new contributors start with smaller issues and let us know before you contribute to prevent duplication of work.

It is also a good idea to add a comment to an issue that you are working on to let everyone know. If you stop working on it, also please let us know.
